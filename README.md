# my_api
Node.js, the Express framework, and MongoDB, I'm focusing on the fundamental REST routes and basic database interaction. I'm building a simple API boilerplate that can then be used as the foundation for any app in my case I'm building one for my new website.

Things neeed to get started. Knowledge of REST APIs and CRUD operations, plus basic JavaScript knowledge. I use ES6 (arrow functions), but nothing too complex.
