# my_api
Node.js, the Express framework, and MongoDB, I'm focusing on the fundamental REST routes and basic database interaction. I'm building a simple API boilerplate that can then be used as the foundation for any app in my case I'm building one for my new website.
I like using nodemon as a dev dependency because it restarts the server for me with a few simple commands (node server.js/ nodemon server.js) 

Things I need to get started. Knowledge of REST APIs and CRUD operations, plus basic JavaScript knowledge. I use ES6 (arrow functions), but nothing too complex.
